# Onnotangu

A Discord bot for rolling (and keeping )dice, L5R 4e style. 

## Want to add the Moon to your Channel?

Onnotangu is still in development; there are still plenty of potential features to add, UX to improve, optimization work, testing to do and there are certainly bugs hiding that need to be squashed.
If that doesn't put you off, then by all means click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=468926033165549579&scope=bot) for the Discord invite.

## How can I help?

If you are a developer feel free to download the project and tinker, or contact me with questions/suggestions. Arenjii is written in Javascript.

If you are not a developer, I could always use people dedicated and/or crazy enough to make some of the weirdest rolls possible and try to break the bot, point out where I've gotten the rules wrong and give feedback and suggestions about every aspect of it.
